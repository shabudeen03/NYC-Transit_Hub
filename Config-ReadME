Development Environment:
	Frontend: React.js w/ CSS
	Backend: Express/Node
	Version Control: Git + GitHub
	Deployment: TBD
	Testing: TBD

Configurating the Environment:
	1. Install Prerequisites
		Node.js
		Git
	2. Fetch the repository (after you accept contribution invitation)
	3. Setup Backend
		mkdir backend (already done by me)
		cd backend (already done by me)
		npm init (press enter until the command is completed)
        npm install express cors axios dotenv nodemon gtfs-realtime-bindings gtfs bcrypt jsonwebtoken mongoose  unzipper csv-parse
	4. Setup Frontend
		npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react
		cd frontend
		npm install 
		npm install axios react-map-gl mapbox-gl
	5. Add testing
		Frontend: 
			npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
		Backend: TBD

Running the Application
	Open 2 terminals (one for backend, the other for frontend and navigate on both to the respective directories)
	Backend: node app.js 

	Frontend: npm run dev
		On your browser, going to this site: "http://localhost:5173/" should now show the message as a string

Running the tests
	Frontend: npm test
	Backend: TBD

GitHub USEFUL
	1. Get updates from remote branch to your local branch
		git checkout your-branch
		git pull origin testdev
	2. Push your local changes to remote branch 
		git push origin target-branch-to-push
	3. Push to another remote branch (for example, tested changes to testdev and at the very end to main for submission)
		git push origin your-branch:main 
			This pushes changes from your-branch to remote branch main
