Development Environment:
	Frontend: React.js w/ CSS
	Backend: Python + Flask + SQLite
	Version Control: Git + GitHub
	Deployment: TBD
	Testing: Jest (for React), Pytest (for Flask)

Configurating the Environment:
	1. Install Prerequisites
		Node.js
		Python 
		Git
	2. Fetch the repository (after you accept contribution invitation)
	3. Setup Backend
		mkdir backend (already done by me)
		cd backend (already done by me)
		python -m venv venv
		source venv/Scripts/activate
		pip install flask flask-cors sqlalchemy
	4. Setup Frontend
		npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react
		cd frontend
		npm install
	5. Add testing
		Frontend: 
			npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
		Backend: 
			pip install pytest
			touch test_app.py

Running the Application
	Open 2 terminals (one for backend, the other for frontend and navigate on both to the respective directories)
	Backend: 
		1. source venv/Scripts/activate
		2. run either: flask run OR python app.py
		On your browser, going to this site: "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/hello" should give a JSON 

	Frontend: npm run dev
		On your browser, going to this site: "http://localhost:5173/" should now show the message as a string

Running the tests
	Frontend: npm test
	Backend: pytest

GitHub USEFUL
	1. Get updates from remote branch to your local branch
		git checkout your-branch
		git pull origin testdev
	2. Push your local changes to remote branch 
		git push origin target-branch-to-push
	3. Push to another remote branch (for example, tested changes to testdev and at the very end to main for submission)
		git push origin your-branch:main 
			This pushes changes from your-branch to remote branch main
